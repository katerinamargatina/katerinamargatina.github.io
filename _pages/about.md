I am a third (final) year Ph.D. student at the [Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) department at the University of SheffieldðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. 
I am working on natural language processing & machine learning, 
I am a member of the [SheffieldNLP](https://twitter.com/sheffieldnlp?lang=en) group,
and my Ph.D. is funded by an [Amazon Alexa Fellowship](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-startups/alexa-fund/alexa-fellowship/graduate).
My two amazing supervisors are [Nikolaos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/) (main) and [LoÃ¯c Barrault](https://loicbarrault.github.io/).
My research mostly focuses on active learning, low-resource learning, uncertainty estimation, robustness and language modeling 
-- but I'm fascinated by other topics as well! 


Until very recently, I lived in beautiful CopenhagenðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°, where I spent 8 amazing months visiting the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) group. 
I have the pleasure of working with [Anders SÃ¸gaard](https://anderssoegaard.github.io/) and the rest of the team on exciting projects on learning from disagreement, fairness and cross-cultural NLP!

In 2019, I was working as a Machine Learning Engineer at the awesome Greek startup [DeepSea Technologies](https://www.deepsea.ai/). 
Prior, I obtained my diploma on [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en)
at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·.

under the supervision of 
[Alexandros Potamianos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQViyUAAAAJ&hl=en).

In my free time, I enjoy yoga, movies and long walks (with iced coffee). I love tennis, skiing, hiking, and bouldering (even though I am not good at it)! 

[//]: # I am generally looking forward to the post-Covid era, when we will be able to enjoy travelling again.ðŸ¦‹

I've come to realise that it is very important to me that my research has a positive impact in the real world, so feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on cool projects that aim to develop language technologies for social good.ðŸ¦‹
