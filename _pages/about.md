I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon in NYC, working with the AWS AI Fundamental Research team on Agentic AI. My main focus is on improving how LLM agents work—making them more useful, reliable, and efficient. Previous projects include [multi-agents collaboration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-bedrock-announces-general-availability-of-multi-agent-collaboration/), [long-term memory](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/agents-for-amazon-bedrock-now-support-memory-retention-and-code-interpretation-preview/) and evaluation in Amazon Bedrock Agents and currently I am working on the [AWS Security Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/security-agent/).

I earned my PhD in Computer Science at the University Sheffield, under the supervision of [Prof. Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/). I researched [active learning algorithms for data efficient LLMs](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/35849/).
Along the way, I spent time as a Research Scientist intern at Meta AI (FAIR) in London where I explored the intersection of [in-context and active learning methods for LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.334/), and at AWS in NYC where I studied [temporal robustness of LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.211/).
I also visited the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) group at the University of Copenhagen, where I worked on learning from disagreement and [cross-cultural NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.482/).

Earlier this year, I did an internship as an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services &#40;[AWS]&#40;https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/language/&#41;&#41; in NYC, working with the AI human language technology group.)

Before my doctoral studies (i.e., what feels like a lifetime ago), I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [DeepSea Technologies](https://www.deepsea.ai/). 
In my undergrad, I studied [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
