Hello world.ðŸ¦‹ I am a final year Ph.D. student at the CS dept. at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs), working on natural language processing & machine learning.
My advisor is [Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/) and my work is funded by an [Amazon Alexa Fellowship](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-startups/alexa-fund/alexa-fellowship/graduate).
My research focuses on [active learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03764), [evaluation & benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12297) and [in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14264) -- but I'm fascinated by other topics as well!

During my Ph.D., I have interned at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) (FAIR) in London with [Jane Dwivedi-Yu](https://janedwivedi.github.io/) and [Timo Schick](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=k8CKy5UAAAAJ&hl=de) (2023), where I worked on [active learning for in-context learning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14264).
I have interned at Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/language/)) in NYC with [Miguel Ballesteros](http://miguelballesteros.com/) and the AI human language technology group (2022), where I worked on [evaluation of temporal concept drift of MLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.211/). 

I have also visited the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) group in the University of Copenhagen (2021), where I had the pleasure of working with [Anders SÃ¸gaard](https://anderssoegaard.github.io/) and the rest of the team on learning from disagreement and [cross-cultural NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.482/).

Earlier this year, I did an internship as an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services &#40;[AWS]&#40;https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/language/&#41;&#41; in NYC, working with the AI human language technology group.)

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at the awesome Greek startup [DeepSea Technologies](https://www.deepsea.ai/). 
In my undergrad, I studied [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

[//]: # In my free time, I enjoy yoga, movies, and long walks (with iced coffee). I love tennis, skiing, hiking, and bouldering -- even though I am not good at it! 

[//]: # I've come to realise that it is important to me that my research has a positive impact in the real world, so feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on cool projects that aim to develop language technologies for social good.ðŸ¦‹
