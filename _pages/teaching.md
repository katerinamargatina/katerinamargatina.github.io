I have been a teaching assistant in the Computer Science department at the University of Sheffield in the following modules:
* Natural Language Processing COM6513 (2021) 
* Text Processing COM3110/4115 (2020)
* Natural Language Processing COM4513/6513 (2020)

My responsibilities include weekly laboratory sessions where I assisted students with Python and Unix, and various concepts regarding text processing, machine learning and deep learning.
I marked semester assignments following a pre-determined scheme set by the course leader.
I have also experience in face-to-face teaching with students that needed extra guidance.

I am very happy to have been a co-supervisor of [Atsuki Yamaguchi](https://gucci-j.github.io/about/), along with [George Chrysostomou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3eShIkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/). 
Atsuki was a Master's student at the University of Sheffield and managed to publish his project on EMNLP 2021!ðŸŽŠ
